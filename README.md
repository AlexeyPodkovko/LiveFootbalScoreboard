The scoreboard supports the following operations:
  1. Start a new match, assuming initial score 0 â€“ 0 and adding it the scoreboard.
    This should capture following parameters:
      a. Home team
      b. Away team
  2. Update score. This should receive a pair of absolute scores: home team score and away
    team score.
  3. Finish match currently in progress. This removes a match from the scoreboard.
  4. Get a summary of matches in progress ordered by their total score. The matches with the
    same total score will be returned ordered by the most recently started match in the
    scoreboard.

Notes:
 - Most observations and decisions have been documented in the Javadoc. 
 - Additional validation, such as preventing negative scores during updates and others, could have been implemented. However, they were not added since the general validation mechanism is already apparent and easily extendable.
